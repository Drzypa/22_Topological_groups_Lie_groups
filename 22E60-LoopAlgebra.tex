Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra over a field $\mathbb{K}$. The \textbf{loop algebra} based on $\mathfrak{g}$ is defined to be $\mathcal{L}(\mathfrak{g}) := \mathfrak{g} \otimes_{\mathbb{K}} \mathbb{K}[t, t^{-1}]$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{K}$. The Lie bracket is determined by

\[ \left[ X \otimes t^k, Y \otimes t^l \right] = \left[ X, Y \right]_{\mathfrak{g}} \otimes t^{k+l} \]

where $\left[\,,\,\right]_{\mathfrak{g}}$ denotes the Lie bracket from $\mathfrak{g}$.

This clearly determines a Lie bracket. For instance the three term sum in the Jacobi identity (for elements which are homogeneous in $t$) simplifies to the three term sum for the Jacobi identity in $\mathfrak{g}$ tensored with a power of $t$ and thus is zero in $\mathcal{L}(\mathfrak{g})$.

The name ``loop algebra'' comes from the fact that this Lie algebra arises in the study of Lie algebras of loop groups.  For the time being, assume that $\mathbb{K}$ is the real or complex numbers so that the familiar structures of analysis and topology are available.  Consider the set of all mappings from the circle $S^1$ (we may think of this circle more concretely as the unit circle of the complex plane) to a finite-dimensional Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra is $\mathfrak{g}$.  We may make this set into a group by defining multiplication pointwise: given $a, b \colon S^1 \to G$, we define $(a \cdot b)(x) = a(x) 
\cdot b(x)$.
