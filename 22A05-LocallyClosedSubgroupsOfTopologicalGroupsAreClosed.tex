\begin{document}
Let $G$ be a Hausdorff topological group and $H \subseteq G$ a subgroup (which is a topological group itself under the subspace topology).

{\bf Theorem -} If $H$ is locally closed in $G$ then $H$ is closed.

In particular we see that if $H$ is either
\begin{itemize}
\item open, or
\item \PMlinkname{discrete}{Discrete}, or
\item locally compact,
\end{itemize}
then $H$ is closed.
