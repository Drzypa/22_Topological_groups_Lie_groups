{\bf Theorem -} Let $G$ be a Hausdorff topological group. Then the center of $G$ is a closed normal subgroup.

$\,$

{\bf \emph{Proof:}} Let $Z$ be the center of $G$. We know that $Z$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Let us see that it is closed.

Let $s \in \overline{Z}$, the closure of $Z$. There exists a net $\{s_{\lambda}\}$ in $Z$ converging to $s$. Then, for every $g \in G$, we have that
\begin{itemize}
\item $gs_{\lambda} \longrightarrow gs$
\item $s_{\lambda}g \longrightarrow sg$
\end{itemize}
But since $Z$ is the center of $G$ we have that $gs_{\lambda} = s_{\lambda}g$, and as $G$ is Hausdorff one must have $sg=gs$. This implies that $s \in Z$, i.e. $Z$ is closed. $\square$
