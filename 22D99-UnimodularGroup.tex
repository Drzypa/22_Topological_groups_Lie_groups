\begin{document}
A locally compact Hausdorff topological group is said to be \emph{\PMlinkescapetext{unimodular}} if
its left Haar measure is equal to its right Haar measure.

A group is \PMlinkescapetext{unimodular} when its modular function is equal to 1. 

For example, an Abelian group or a compact group or discrete group is \PMlinkescapetext{unimodular}.
